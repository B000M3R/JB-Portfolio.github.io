### Project 1: ServiceNow Catalogue Optimization
<h3 style="color:blue">Summary</h3>
In the ServiceNow Catalogue Optimisation Project, our aim was to tackle the complexities and inefficiencies of our outdated service request catalogue system. The project revolved around streamlining, modernising and re-designing the forms for the new ServiceNow platform. The old forms had become problematic due to years of ad-hoc adjustments and lack of governance. Our objective was to improve the look and feel of the new request forms, enhance the request fulfillment process, reduce lead times, and lay a robust groundwork for the new ServiceNow system's success, ensuring a more agile and responsive service management environment.

### Situation
The legacy ServiceNow platform, hosting our request catalogue, had become increasingly unwieldy due to over customisation and organic growth over the years, leading to a sprawling array of 800+ service request forms. The lack of effective governance had also resulted in a cumbersome request management processes, significantly elongating the lead times for ordering catalogue items. With plans to eventually decommission the legacy system, the immediate objective was to baseline the existing setup and forms and strategise for the efficient creation of new forms in the new ServiceNow system. As an initial step, the first series of sprints were dedicated to prioritising and addressing the top 100 forms. This targeted approach was crucial to meet a tight deadline and in streamlining operations and setting the stage for a more manageable and effective service request process.
