### Project 1: Service Request Catalogue Optimisation
<h2 style="color:blue">Summary</h2>
The Request Catalogue Optimisation Project aimed to address the request form inefficiencies and outdated request management process of our existing service request catalogue within ServiceNow. Our mission was to revitalise the user experience by streamlining, modernising, and redesigning the forms within the new ServiceNow platform. By enhancing the look and feel of the request forms and improving the fulfillment process, we sought to reduce lead times and establish a strong foundation for the request catalogues future. The project's success was measured by its contribution to a more agile and responsive service management environment, reflecting our commitment to continuous improvement and excellence in IT service delivery.

### Situation
Our legacy ServiceNow platform, containing over 800 service request forms, had become bloated and inefficient due to over-customisation and lack of governance, leading to cumbersome request management processes and extended lead times. The need for a complete overhaul was evident as we prepared to transition away from the outdated and old ServiceNow system. The initial phase focused on baselining the existing setup and targeting the top 100 forms for immediate attention and redesign. This phase was essential in managing the scope effectively, meeting tight deadlines, and ensuring a smooth transition to a more streamlined and effective service request process in the new ServiceNow environment.

### Action
1. **Assessment and Prioritisation** In partnership with internal Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and two key vendors, we conducted a thorough review of the existing 800+ service request forms. We leveraged their expertise and insights to identify and prioritise the top 100 forms for the initial phase of optimisation, focusing on usage frequency and business impact. This collaborative effort ensured a comprehensive understanding of both the technical and functional aspects of the service request forms, setting a solid foundation for the subsequent redesign and development process.
2. **Form Design and Development** Initiated the redesign process by engaging with form owners through a structured review, using a specialised questionnaire to record their insights and requirements. This crucial step informed the collaborative effort with key stakeholders to redesign the forms, focusing on user experience and operational efficiency. We then leveraged best practices in UI/UX to ensure the new forms were intuitive and user-friendly. We employed Agile methodology for iterative design and development, integrating continuous improvement and regular stakeholder feedback.
3. **Training and Implementation** Collaboratively designed and developed comprehensive training with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and a ServiceNow training specialist, focusing on end-users and IT staff. Conducted global 'show and tell' events to demonstrate the new forms, facilitate understanding, and address queries. This ensured a smooth transition to the new system. The optimised forms were rolled out in phased stages to effectively manage change and ensure seamless adoption.
4. **Quality Assurance and Feedback**  Implemented rigorous testing protocols to ensure functionality and performance of new forms. Established a feedback loop with users to identify any issues and make adjustments as needed, ensuring the forms met all user requirements and business needs.
5. **Documentation and Governance** Created detailed documentation for the new forms and the request management process, ensuring sustainability and ease of management. Established clear governance structures to prevent the issues of over-customisation and lack of control experienced with the legacy system.
